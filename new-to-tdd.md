# Instructions (New to TDD)

Read through the problem together

Decide on an implementation plan (what to build and in what order)

Clone the GitHub repo and create a branch

One person will code a small piece of functionality while the other watches and helps to keep big picture in mind.

Write unit test for code written.

Swap roles

Delete everything. Start by rewriting the unit test. Keep the test as small as you can. Run the test and verify it fails

Swap roles

Implement just enough code to see the test pass. Run test to see test pass

Swap roles

Look at any opportunities to refactor. If you can make the code SOLID/DRY do so. Complete the refactor. Rerun test to ensure everything still passes

Swap roles

Repeat

When complete push branch to GitHub
